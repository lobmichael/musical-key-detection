# musical-key-detection
A musical key detection tutorial

This is a python notebook which can be run on google colab. First you have to load the GTZAN genre dataset onto your Google Drive.

If you want to run this locally you'll need python 3.6+, keras-cpu, tensorflow 1.14, numpy, matplotlib, pickle, pandas, librosa and madmom

The paths then must be adjusted throughout the code to folders inside your Google Drive as per the comments

The data augmentation functionality is missing as of yet
